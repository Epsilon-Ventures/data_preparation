What is modulation and demodulation? Write some advantages of modulation and describe the principle of frequency modulation,"What are the benefits of modulation and demodulation, and how does frequency modulation work? Modulation and demodulation are processes of transforming a signal from one form to another. Modulation is the process of converting a signal into another form, while demodulation is the opposite process of recovering the original signal from the modified form. Modulation is important in communication systems as it allows signals to be sent through different media, such as radio waves, optical fibers, or coaxial cables. The primary advantages of modulation are increased signal strength, increased distance of transmission, and better immunity to interference. Another advantage is that modulation allows multiple signals to be transmitted at the same time using the same medium, as each signal is modulated to a different frequency. The principle of frequency modulation (FM) involves changing the frequency of a signal in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal. This modulation technique is useful for transmitting audio signals, such as music, as it maintains the fidelity of the signal better than other types of modulation. FM is also more immune to noise interference than other types of modulation."

Fourth Normal Form (4NF) is a database normalization technique used to reduce the data redundancy from a database. It builds on 3NF and is based on the principle of multi-valued dependence. This form applies when there is more than one multi-valued dependency in a table.

An example of 4NF is a database that stores information about students and courses. For example, Student_Name, Course_Name and Grade are three attributes and there is a relationship between them. In order to satisfy 4NF, the database must contain a separate table for each multi-valued dependency. In this example, there would be three tables, one for Student_Name, one for Course_Name and one for Grade.
