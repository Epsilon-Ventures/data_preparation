What is modulation and demodulation? Write some advantages of modulation and describe the principle of frequency modulation,"What are the benefits of modulation and demodulation, and how does frequency modulation work? Modulation and demodulation are processes of transforming a signal from one form to another. Modulation is the process of converting a signal into another form, while demodulation is the opposite process of recovering the original signal from the modified form. Modulation is important in communication systems as it allows signals to be sent through different media, such as radio waves, optical fibers, or coaxial cables. The primary advantages of modulation are increased signal strength, increased distance of transmission, and better immunity to interference. Another advantage is that modulation allows multiple signals to be transmitted at the same time using the same medium, as each signal is modulated to a different frequency. The principle of frequency modulation (FM) involves changing the frequency of a signal in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal. This modulation technique is useful for transmitting audio signals, such as music, as it maintains the fidelity of the signal better than other types of modulation. FM is also more immune to noise interference than other types of modulation."

Normalization is a technique used to organize data in a database. It is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a set of rules so that data is stored in only one place, thereby reducing data redundancy and preventing anomalies from arising.

Fourth Normal Form (4NF) is a database normalization technique used to reduce the data redundancy from a database. It builds on 3NF and is based on the principle of multi-valued dependence. This form applies when there is more than one multi-valued dependency in a table.

An example of 4NF is a database that stores information about students and courses. For example, Student_Name, Course_Name and Grade are three attributes and there is a relationship between them. In order to satisfy 4NF, the database must contain a separate table for each multi-valued dependency.

To prove a statement using mathematical induction, one must first prove that the statement is true for the base case (usually 0 or 1). Then, one must assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary number n and prove that it is true for the next number (n+1). If both of these steps can be completed, then the statement is true for all natural numbers. Mathematical induction is valid because it is based on the principle of induction, which is a logical principle that has been accepted as valid for centuries."
